# HTML_CSS_SBA
This Project was Skill-Based. I used HTML and CSS only. 
First step I did was create a main folder called PerScholas and added another folder called HTML and from there I started writing a simple layout for my HTML home page. I created a Header, Footer, and main content section in the middle. I also made an attempt at a carousel. I was able to place images. My CSS took hours because their all diff files for diff pages. I connect all the webpages together placing hyperlinks and styling them by putting them into flex boxes and I put in some paragrpahs with animations to make it more eye catching and appealing and for the whole body I added simple styles and colors. For the form I had to look at some refrences.  This project is just a small part and I will continue to build on it.
